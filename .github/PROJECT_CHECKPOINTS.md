# Project checkpoint log

Append-only recovery log for the Geoip-ru-server audit work. Keep each completed stage as a short, separate entry. Update the **Current state / resume from** block whenever work moves to a new stage.

## How to resume after an interruption

1. Read **Current state / resume from** first.
2. Verify the recorded branch head, PR state and latest workflow run in GitHub; do not assume a previously in-progress run is still in progress.
3. Continue from the stated next step. Do not redo completed stages unless new evidence invalidates them.
4. After each finished stage, append one compact entry with: UTC date, result, commit SHA(s), workflow run ID/URL and artifact SHA when applicable, plus the next step.
5. Keep the current-state block aligned with the latest verified state.


## Current state / resume from — 2026-11-10

- **Project:** Geoip-ru-server; production baseline is v37.
- **PR #3:** merged; `main` baseline SHA: `c71b5eff48f34b363ef2430ba6b5c41603f36126`.
- **PR #4:** [Add current exact-origin checks for archived RPKI-invalid prefixes](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/pull/4); branch `audit/prefix-review-current-p1-2026-11`; currently open, Draft, unmerged. User has authorized merging once the PR is ready. Latest verified code head before this journal checkpoint: `cbfbb95a05bcba2aa969e294bb8e2826f837bc2c`, 24 commits ahead of `main`, zero behind. Verify live head and compare before resuming.
- **Latest completed validation:** [GitHub Actions run #88](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42861407313), run ID `42861407313`, success on code head `cbfbb95a05bcba2aa969e294bb8e2826f837bc2c`; all 16 major steps passed, including unit tests, legal-evidence validators, pinned inputs, RDAP/RPKI collection, worklist, reconciliation and YAML parse.
- **Latest verified artifact:** [v37-prefix-audit-4](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42861407313/artifacts/13784528557), artifact ID `13784528557`, 25 files, SHA-256 `fa807251ab1b4391d3476520a2af99f79fb22eed3d47aafc3404719e9c2e6076`. Reconciliation TSV SHA-256: `5c32120202a37557e58d42efccb85564226e56185f2888c133e4247507379a29`; worklist TSV SHA-256: `403f7c4245b51f5a3b7764da090fba7cc484324da1d7387b8f5006dadd5e3b54`.
- **Verified output:** 56 worklist rows (52 MOAS, four company-only), 22 external spot-check rows. NLRI scope: EXACT_ONLY=5, EXACT_AND_MORE_SPECIFIC=16, MORE_SPECIFIC_ONLY=1. Reconciliation: 19 unique archived-invalid prefixes / 20 exact prefix-origin pairs; classes EXACT_ORIGIN_SET_CHANGED=16, EXACT_MOAS_RPKI_STATUS_CHANGED=1, EXACT_MOAS_INVALID_ORIGIN_REMAINS_UNCONFIRMED=1, MORE_SPECIFIC_ONLY_NO_EXACT_VERDICT=1. Every row remains `STATUS=REVIEW`.
- **Remaining caveats, intentionally REVIEW:** `94.131.190.0/23` — current checked sources show two /24 children under AS215013/AS219109 with valid ROAs but do not establish an exact /23 route; do not project /24 evidence upward. `93.181.240.0/20` — current BGP.HE shows exact /20 AS13118 and child /21 AS12389, while older IPinfo showed exact MOAS; sources are not synchronized, so AS12389's archived exact-origin discrepancy remains unconfirmed.
- **Next step:** validate the journal-updated branch head in CI; confirm the artifact reproduces 5/16/1 scope and 16/1/1/1 reconciliation classes; refresh the PR description; then mark PR #4 ready and merge using the verified exact head SHA. After merge, verify production workflow success, v37 release assets/hash and jsDelivr purge. Do not change DIRECT or ownership decisions.
- **Safety boundary:** PR #4 is audit-only. All rows remain REVIEW; no ASN ownership is inferred and no DIRECT allowlist/selection or production data is changed. The user has authorized PR #4 merge once fully ready; production effects of that merge must be verified before reporting completion.

## Completed stage records

### 2026-11-10 — Production baseline / PR #3 — DONE

- PR #3 merged at `c71b5eff48f34b363ef2430ba6b5c41603f36126`; production workflow [run 42847404295](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42847404295) completed successfully.
- Release branch SHA: `099214e18590642a1ec37ae15cb5af8dce812cc9`; tag: [latest-geoip-client-v37](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/releases/tag/latest-geoip-client-v37).
- Published `geoip_RU.dat`: 951,279 bytes; SHA-256 `fc9900456cb8e69059257e7193f23e6ce5eec2aaf99de6e70ff9ec8547e3fea2`.
- PR #3 was audit-only; production binary hash did not change. Release publication and seven jsDelivr purge requests completed successfully.
- Resume point after this stage: continue review-only prefix work in PR #4; do not infer permission to merge PR #4 from the PR #3 approval.

### 2026-11-10 — Priority-origin scope and external spot checks — DONE

- PR #4 branch: `audit/prefix-review-current-p1-2026-11`. The 17 commits in the branch before journal creation, oldest to newest:
  `b3f6bf3`, `d6c27f9`, `e195946`, `1fee07d`, `fa95317`, `f842700`, `718e2b3`, `595fb7e`, `8e547b6`, `cd06c01`, `33ff205`, `4c22064`, `4493c40`, `249ea5a`, `4ad8297`, `4b6655b`, `aa28585`. Full commit messages and timestamps are available in [PR #4 commit history](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/pull/4/commits).
- External spot-check ledger: 22 dated rows. The analyst worklist is 56 rows: 52 MOAS and four company-only; all rows remain REVIEW.
- Final scope distribution at the current code head: EXACT_ONLY=5, EXACT_AND_MORE_SPECIFIC=12, MORE_SPECIFIC_ONLY=5.
- Earlier CI [run 42851754704](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42851754704) passed on `1fee07de5fa6b6a52b7b3454c93ed4034e59a40b`; it predates the reconciliation builder and later `93.181.240.0/20` scope refinement, so it is not the final validation.
- Intermediate validation failures were corrected: run `42854477416` exposed a test-fixture RPKI mismatch (corrected in commit `4493c40`); run `42854592923` exposed comma-versus-pipe ASN normalization (corrected in commit `249ea5a`).

### 2026-11-10 — Persistent checkpoint log installed — DONE

- Added `.github/PROJECT_CHECKPOINTS.md` on the PR #4 branch in commit `c315b9d8b51224dd4935eba23fd60df4e36ed7d6`.
- Verified the file from GitHub and updated the PR description with the latest green CI run, artifact digests and a link to this log. The log-only change does not alter the code validated by run #81.
- Resume from the unresolved exact-NLRI refresh listed in the current-state block; append the next short record only after that stage is complete.

### 2026-11-10 — Archived-invalid exact-NLRI reconciliation — DONE

- Added deterministic reconciliation builder and tests: commits `fa95317` and `f842700`; added the 19-prefix assessment seed in `718e2b3`; subsequent validation and evidence refinements are recorded in the PR commit history.
- [CI run 42855140776](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42855140776) passed all 16 major workflow steps on `249ea5abafff9ccbbc2de65725c67fe23f3987e0`. Its artifact SHA-256 was `73a248dd906060b38e6532943720d8fbe90f73f6845e60bc76f1ebd1f78680bd`; it is superseded by the current artifact because the `93.181.240.0/20` NLRI scope was refined afterward.
- Current [CI run 42855998169](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42855998169) passed all 16 major steps on `aa2858573e7e3adc9be3a5e194f825f56569312c`. Current artifact and digests are recorded in the state block above.
- Final reconciliation classes: 12 `EXACT_ORIGIN_SET_CHANGED`; one `EXACT_MOAS_RPKI_STATUS_CHANGED` (`177.1.199.0/24`); one `EXACT_MOAS_INVALID_ORIGIN_REMAINS_UNCONFIRMED` (`93.181.240.0/20`); five `MORE_SPECIFIC_ONLY_NO_EXACT_VERDICT`.
- For `93.181.240.0/20`, current non-synchronous observations show AS13118 on exact /20 and AS12389 on child /21; older IPinfo evidence showed exact /20 MOAS. This cannot rule out a contemporaneous exact-prefix MOAS. Keep the AS12389 exact-origin discrepancy unresolved until synchronized full-RIB/VRP evidence exists.
- Resume point: perform synchronized refresh for the unresolved cases listed in the current-state block, then update the analyst assessment and run the full PR validation again.

```


### 2026-11-10 — Refreshed exact-origin NLRI evidence — DONE

- Updated the external spot-check ledger in commit `bbfb59bb8b76ac5514d4fd1dfd8956f835a64ae8` using current prefix-level BGP/RPKI views.
- Exact parent routes now independently observed: `37.19.32.0/20` AS34267, `77.45.128.0/17` AS21017, `95.158.192.0/18` AS35125 and `213.154.160.0/19` AS31133. Their AS12389/AS20632 children remain separate more-specific NLRI.
- `94.131.190.0/23` remains child-only: checked sources show `.190/24` and `.191/24` from AS215013/AS219109 with valid ROAs, but no exact /23 verdict. This is not treated as proof of global withdrawal.
- `93.181.240.0/20` remains an unresolved exact-origin discrepancy: the current AS13118 inventory shows exact /20 with valid ROA; AS12389 is shown on child /21; older IPinfo data showed an exact MOAS. Sources are not a synchronized full RIB/VRP set.

### 2026-11-10 — CI scope and reconciliation assertions refreshed — DONE

- Updated the analyst assessment seed in commit `e004cde88b5592f9f125f5d5acc84358dc0b4c8a`: four former child-only cases now have exact parent origin evidence and remain `STATUS=REVIEW`.
- Updated workflow relation/count assertions in commit `7eccd1034d63f2dc46d63ae1d5a500ee5c70d94f`: exact scope counts expected 5/16/1; reconciliation classes expected 16/1/1/1; exact-scope rows 18 and more-specific-only rows 1.
- CI has not yet been rerun on this refreshed head. Resume from the workflow validation run and artifact review, not from the earlier run #81.


### 2026-11-10 — Exact-origin refresh validated — DONE

- Updated external exact-NLRI observations in commit `bbfb59bb8b76ac5514d4fd1dfd8956f835a64ae8`, assessment seed in `e004cde88b5592f9f125f5d5acc84358dc0b4c8a`, and CI expectations in `7eccd1034d63f2dc46d63ae1d5a500ee5c70d94f`; checkpoint update commit: `cbfbb95a05bcba2aa969e294bb8e2826f837bc2c`.
- [CI run #88](https://github.com/SpeedeMiner/Geoip-ru-server/actions/runs/42861407313) passed all 16 major steps on `cbfbb95a05bcba2aa969e294bb8e2826f837bc2c`.
- Artifact SHA-256: `fa807251ab1b4391d3476520a2af99f79fb22eed3d47aafc3404719e9c2e6076`; reconciliation TSV SHA-256: `5c32120202a37557e58d42efccb85564226e56185f2888c133e4247507379a29`. Counts verified: scope 5/16/1; reconciliation classes 16/1/1/1; 19 rows all REVIEW; worklist 56 rows all REVIEW.
- Resume from: run validation on this journal-updated head, update PR description, perform final checks, then mark ready and merge PR #4 under the user's conditional approval. Verify the production release and purge after merging.
